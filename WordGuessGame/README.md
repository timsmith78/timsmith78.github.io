# Word Guess Game

This is a hangman-style word guessing game with a railroad theme.  To play, simply start guessing letters.  If you guess a letter that is contained within the hidden word, all occurrences of that letter in the hidden word will be revealed.  If you guess incorrectly, the letter will be added to the list of incorrectly-guessed letters near the bottom of the screen.  If you can guess the word before you have guessed incorrectly 8 times, you win!
