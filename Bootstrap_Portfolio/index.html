                    <p class="card-text">Greetings from Minneapolis! On these pages you will find a little bit of info about me, some samples
                        of my work, and a few different ways to contact me.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">I am currently a software engineer working on compiler development at Cray, Inc. We see to it that high-performance
                        applications are optimized for Cray's supercomputers, which can contain tens of thousands of CPU
                        cores. Prior to that, I spent 14 years at Intel in Portland, OR testing their microprocessors. As
                        one of the first people to see and use many of the newest CPUs that Intel created in the last decade
                        or so, I've long witnessed innovation happening in realtime.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">But there is much more to my life than work! Cycling around the Twin Cities and along the many lovely
                        lakes and forests of Minnesota keeps me occupied during the warmer months, and skiing keeps me happy
                        in the winter. In addition, I'm a life-long pianist who enjoys playing everything from classical
                        to contemporary. And anything competitive, like a strategic game, a good debate, or even classic
                        5k run, will always get me excited!
