Rock Paper Scissors for Two

This is a simple web version of the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game.  Only two people can play at a time -- if you log in while the game is full you can watch, but you will not be able to play until one of the other players leaves the page.  

Once a slot is open, you will be prompted to enter your name, after which you can play!  A chat window allows you to talk to (or taunt) your opponent.

Have fun!
